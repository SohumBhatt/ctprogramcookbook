When working with program code, very often you are designing a procedure (or 
"algorithm") that solves a problem in a general way. For instance, in the 
previous chapter one of the exercises had you calculate the wholesale price for 
a stack of books, for a given book price and a given number of books. The code 
you wrote did not solve this problem for a general case, but only for the 
specific case of 60 books costing 24.95 per book. If you want to write code that 
solves problems in a more general way, you need to use variables that store 
values.
